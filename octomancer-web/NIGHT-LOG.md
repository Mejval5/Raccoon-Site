# Octomancer overnight log

## M0-0 Pre-flight (M0 dev)
- Branch: `master`.
- Starting commit (after committing the plan amendment): `7ff54dc0f528e7fdab286d6662eb288387f76326`.
- `git status --short` before starting showed `M octomancer-web/OVERNIGHT.md` and `?? .claude/`. The OVERNIGHT.md change was Beaver's amendment to the "one Sonnet dev per milestone" model (no DECISIONS file changes to commit alongside it); committed it alone as `Overnight plan amendment: one Sonnet dev per milestone`. `.claude/` left untouched (not an Octomancer path).
- `grep octomancer/play firebase.json`: hit (`"octomancer/play/**"` in `hosting.ignore`).
- `octomancer-unity/Assets/Sprites/` exists.
- `python -m http.server 8080 --directory site` serves `/octomancer/` (verified below).
- `grep -c octoStartGame site/octomancer/index.html` = 0 at that instant → the Information-page redesign looked **not** merged to master.

All pre-flight checks passed. Proceeding with M0.

**Correction (found right after M0-1 commit):** Daniel merged `octomancer-archive` into
master himself, concurrently, in commit `8e9aaf39` ("Merge the Octomancer Information
page redesign", 02:35:11, landed a couple of seconds after my pre-flight grep ran and
before my first commit). `site/octomancer/index.html` now does contain `octoStartGame`
(`grep -c` = 2). **M5-1 should run in in-place mode** (edit `site/octomancer/index.html`
directly), not patch mode. I did not touch that file and made no commits that conflict
with the merge; noting this so the M5 dev doesn't rely on the stale M0-0 reading above.

## M0-1/M0-2 Skeleton, loop, input, test harness
Built `site/octomancer/play/{index.html,css/play.css,js/{loop,input,touch-ui,debug,main}.js,tests/index.html}`.
Verified headless via puppeteer-core (scratch tool at `%TEMP%\octo-tools`, chrome.exe)
at 1440x900 and 375x812: 0 console errors both viewports, frame median 0.10ms /
p95 0.20ms (budget <=4ms/<=8ms), `__octo.step(50)` advances `state().time` by
exactly 1.000s, `tests/` PASS 9/9. Touch joystick + Dash/Bomb buttons verified
with synthetic two-pointer PointerEvents (left-half origin, buttons responsive),
no page scroll at 375x812. Numbers and screenshots in `octomancer-web/report/`.
Committed as `M0-1/M0-2 Skeleton, fixed-step loop, input layer, test harness (Badger)`.

## M0-3 Art sort, harvest, first export
Wrote `octomancer-web/ART-SORT.md` (use / also-usable / never, one line each,
straight from OVERNIGHT.md §2 and DECISIONS-2026-09-29.md §2-3). Built
`octomancer-web/tools/export_assets.py` (Pillow, offline only) which:
- rendered `octomancer-web/report/contact-sheet.png` (181 thumbnails, filenames
  labelled) of everything that may ship (bucket A + kept bucket D);
- harvested bucket A + kept bucket D into `octomancer-web/harvest/` as lossless
  WebP (animation sequences at every 2nd frame; the 494 OldAssets 2021
  background frames listed in `MANIFEST.md`, not copied), plus the octopus and
  Acidator creature packs/JSON as-is, the three music tracks (MP3s as-is, the
  Flûte WAV re-encoded to FLAC via ffmpeg), and the `site/img/octomancer/**`
  sources. Total 24 MB (cap 40 MB).
- exported the M1/M2 display-size set into `site/octomancer/play/assets/`
  (31 TilesetMilan edge tiles, BGFar, Plant1/2, 4 bubbles, 3 shell symbols, UI
  Heart) as WebP, 145 KB on disk / 82.8 KB of WebP payload (cap 900 KB), and
  wrote `octomancer-web/ASSETS.md` (one row per shipped file) and
  `octomancer-web/CREDITS.md` ("Art & music: Milan Švancara").

Self-check: grepped `site/octomancer/play/` and `octomancer-web/harvest/` for
every "never" filename from the art rule (OverlayNoise, Stripes, spikes,
Sigils, Splat, Bomb*, Hand1-3, Skull, Wood, Shark, Pearl.png, coin/Coin,
GoldMist, ComingSoon, Mana, compass, crystal08, lock, WheelOfFortune, screw) —
0 hits. `find site/octomancer/play -type f` outside `.webp/.html/.css/.js` —
0 hits (nothing under `play/` is unlisted). No noise/vignette/spikes/portal
files ship as images (code-drawn or excluded per the rule).

Deviation: task listed 483 old background frames; the actual count under
`OldAssets/Sprites/Background/**` is 494 — used the real count.

Committed as `M0-3 Art sort, harvest, first export (Magpie)`.

## M0 status (five-line summary)
- Works: skeleton page loads and runs the fixed-step loop with 0 console
  errors at 1440x900 and 375x812; keyboard + touch input wired; test harness
  green; art sorted, harvested and a first M1/M2-ready asset set exported.
- Numbers: frame median 0.10ms / p95 0.20ms (budget 4/8ms); tests PASS 9/9;
  harvest 24MB (cap 40MB); play/assets 82.8KB of WebP (cap 900KB).
- Skipped: nothing in M0's own rows. Deferred to later milestones (by design,
  not a skip): `__octo.spawn`/`autoDive` stubs (M3/M2), config.js/physics
  (M1), the full 41-file D-kept set beyond what M0-3 needed to harvest is done
  in full already.
- Decisions taken: harvested Acidator's atlas+bytes alongside Octopus (both
  are Creature-pack format per DECISIONS §4, cheap to grab now for M6);
  corrected the old-background-frame count from the plan's 483 to the actual
  494 and logged it here rather than stalling on the discrepancy.
- Next: M1 (swim in a fixed test cave) per OVERNIGHT.md §4.
