# Octomancer overnight log

## M0-0 Pre-flight (M0 dev)
- Branch: `master`.
- Starting commit (after committing the plan amendment): `7ff54dc0f528e7fdab286d6662eb288387f76326`.
- `git status --short` before starting showed `M octomancer-web/OVERNIGHT.md` and `?? .claude/`. The OVERNIGHT.md change was Beaver's amendment to the "one Sonnet dev per milestone" model (no DECISIONS file changes to commit alongside it); committed it alone as `Overnight plan amendment: one Sonnet dev per milestone`. `.claude/` left untouched (not an Octomancer path).
- `grep octomancer/play firebase.json`: hit (`"octomancer/play/**"` in `hosting.ignore`).
- `octomancer-unity/Assets/Sprites/` exists.
- `python -m http.server 8080 --directory site` serves `/octomancer/` (verified below).
- `grep -c octoStartGame site/octomancer/index.html` = 0 → the Information-page redesign is **not** merged to master. M5-1 will need patch mode.

All pre-flight checks passed. Proceeding with M0.
